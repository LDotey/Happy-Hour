~ Welcome to Happy Hour ~

This app has been built as a simple and fun Command Line Interface for users to explore, craft, and catalog cocktails arranged by their alcohol.

The main menu consists of 5 simple options: list, add, delete or update an alcohol, or list all cocktails.

When listing all alcohols the user can then browse through whichever type they select, perhaps depending on what kind of bottle they have on hand. From there recipes can be viewed, crafted, tweaked, or deleted entirely.

Alcohols are listed by type, brand and proof.
Cocktails are listed by name, ingredients and method.

This Python application includes a CLI and implements a set of Object-Relational Mapping functions.

To use the interface, fork and clone this repo and from the terminal run:
python lib/cli.py

Cheers! And enjoy responsibly!
